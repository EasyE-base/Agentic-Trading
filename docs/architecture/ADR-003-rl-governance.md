# ADR-003: RL / Self-Evaluation Governance

## Decision
Centralize self-evaluation and strategy evolution in a Meta-Agent with gated deployment, shadow testing, and human-in-the-loop overrides.

## Context
We want continuous learning while maintaining safety and compliance.

## Consequences
- Measurable, auditable improvements; explicit rollout controls; slower iteration than fully autonomous.
